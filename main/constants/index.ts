            "Easter in Britain means family gatherings, roast dinners, and mountains of chocolate. In fact, for 65% of Brits, the word “Easter” brings chocolate to mind first. So, it’s no wonder shops sell around 80 million Easter eggs yearly, with the average child unwrapping eight.",
            "But what happens after the egg hunts end? Piles of chocolate go uneaten, and when the excitement fades, some people throw out their leftovers. However, instead of binning excess chocolate or plastic eggs, you can learn how to put them to good use.",
            "Let’s explore ways to enjoy an eco-friendly Easter by creatively repurposing your eggs.",
            "What to do with leftover Easter egg chocolate",
            "Are you tired of eating plain chocolate shards? Transform those leftover Easter eggs into something even better. Learn how to turn them into indulgent drinks, desserts, and treats with our leftover Easter egg recipe suggestions.",
            "Hot chocolate: You can create a decadent hot chocolate with leftover Easter eggs by adding softened pieces to hot milk and cocoa. For an extra treat, top with cream, mini marshmallows, and crushed chocolate mini eggs.",
            "Chocolate milkshake: Do you prefer something cold? Blend chocolate egg pieces with milk, vanilla ice cream, double cream, and a sprinkle of hot chocolate powder for a thick, creamy milkshake that tastes like Easter in a glass. Serve in a hollow chocolate egg for a fun twist.",
            "Chocolate bark: Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie, then spread it onto a tray. Sprinkle over nuts, dried fruit, marshmallows, or crushed biscuits, and swirl in melted white or dark chocolate for contrast. Chill the bark, break it into pieces, and share your creation with friends and family.",
            "Easter egg cheesecake: Turn hollow chocolate eggs into mini cheesecakes. Fill each half with a mix of crushed digestive biscuits, butter, mascarpone, soft cheese, icing sugar, cocoa powder, and double cream. Decorate with more leftover Easter chocolate for a showstopping dessert.",
            "Chocolate-dipped strawberries: Give chocolate a fresh spin by dipping strawberries into melted Easter egg pieces. Melt the chocolate slowly in a bain-marie or microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring at intervals. Wash and dry the strawberries, dip them in the chocolate, set them on parchment, and chill in the fridge. For a finishing touch, drizzle with more melted chocolate in contrasting colours.",
            "How to reuse plastic Easter eggs",
            "More families are choosing plastic eggs for Easter hunts, shifting away from chocolate treats due to health and environmental concerns. But what happens when Easter is over? Instead of packing them away for next year, put them to good use.",
            "With these simple ideas, plastic eggs become more than Easter decorations — they’re helpful, fun, and sustainable all year round.",
            "Treasure hunts and games: Plastic eggs aren’t only for Easter hunts. Use them year-round for treasure hunts, magic tricks, or classic egg-and-spoon races. Turn them into learning tools with colour-matching games for young children or number and word-matching challenges for older kids.",
            "Storage: Their lightweight design and snap-shut closure make plastic eggs perfect for storing small items. Keep jewellery tangle-free, organise sewing supplies, or use them for beads, buttons, and other craft materials. They also work as snack containers for nuts, raisins, or small sweets — ideal for lunchboxes or travel.",
            "Gift packaging: Reusable eggs make excellent mini gift boxes. Fill them with stickers, small toys, sweets, erasers, sharpeners, or even folded gift vouchers and cash. For a more thoughtful touch, wrap the eggs in tissue paper, tie them with ribbon, or decorate them with paint and stickers to suit any occasion.",
            "Bath bombs: Turn plastic Easter eggs into DIY bath bomb moulds. Their shape and size make them perfect for crafting fizzy, fragrant bath treats. With a few simple ingredients — most of which you can find in the supermarket — you can create homemade bath bombs in your favourite colours and scents. Make thoughtful gifts, or keep them as a fun self-care treat.",
            "Crafting: Unleash your creativity with plastic egg crafts. Make flower displays, hot air balloon decorations, garlands, door wreaths, or playful characters like bunnies and monsters. Get the kids involved, grab the glue and paint, and see what new ideas you can dream up.",
            "Planting seeds: You can transform plastic eggs and egg cartons into seed starter trays. Nestle half an egg in each carton slot, fill it with potting compost, and plant vegetable, herb, or flower seeds. Once the seedlings are ready to transfer, clean the plastic eggs and reuse them for your next batch.",
            "Bird feeders: Invite more wildlife into your garden with plastic egg bird feeders. Mix water, gelatine, and birdseed, then chill it for 10 minutes. Thread twine through the bottom of each egg for hanging, coat the insides with cooking spray and pack them tightly using the birdseed mixture. Close the eggs and refrigerate until firm. Once set, remove the top half of the plastic egg and hang the feeders outside for birds to enjoy."
